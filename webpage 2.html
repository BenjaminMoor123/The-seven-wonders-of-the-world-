				<h4>The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications built across northern China to protect against invasions from nomadic groups. It is not a single wall but a system of walls, watchtowers, and fortresses built and rebuilt over centuries, with the most well-known sections dating to the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). The total length of all sections is over 21,000 km, making it the longest human-made structure in the world.</h4>

				<h5>I decided to do my project on the 7 wonders of the world because it's a topic I've enjoyed learning about since I was a child. I loved geography and also learning about key architectural landmarks from around the world. Therefore, I thought creating a website about a topic I was passionate about would be an excellent idea.</h5>
